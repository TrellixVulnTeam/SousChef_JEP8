For this recipe, you simply need to mix mashed banana with oats and a little honey and coconut oil.  Then leave the mixture for 10 minutes so the oats can soften and soak up the flavors.  Then throw in the chocolate chips and a pinch of salt and you’re ready to roll the mixture into balls, flatten them out (they don’t spread in the oven, so no worries about cookies melding together or ending up like discs!) and put them in the oven.

The result is a cookie that is golden and a little crispy on the outside, whilst being soft and chewy on the inside.","

If you’re a bit apprehensive about heat, leave out the cayenne pepper and halve the amount of chili powder called for in the recipe. Another route is to use 2 tablespoons of chipotle chili powder instead of the regular chili powder.
About 3 tablespoons of your favorite smoky Mexican chipotle seasoning would also work as a great alternative to the cumin, cayenne pepper, and chili powder called for in the recipe.","
