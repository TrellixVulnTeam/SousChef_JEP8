Saw the apache license in the google cloud vision source code and followed the
link. Although this is a hackathon project I wanted to make sure that I
at least tried to credit people correctly! All boilerplate notations
in the cloudvision api template are taken from the github cloudvision repo.
Thanks to IVYHACKS for this amazing opportunity!
